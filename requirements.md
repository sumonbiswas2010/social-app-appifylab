Task Overview
You are provided with three HTML/CSS pages: Login, Register, and Feed. Your task is to convert these pages into a Next.js application, using any backend and any database of your choice.
You must use React.js or Next.js for the frontend. Please carefully read the features listed below. You do not need to build beyond the listed requirements, but you may add improvements if you have additional time.
Important: Stick to the provided design. Do not change or use any alternative design.

Features to Develop
1. Authentication & Authorization
Implement a secure authentication system (session-based or JWT-based) with proper authorization.


Registration should include: first name, last name, email, and password.


No need to build features like “forgot password” or others to keep it simple.


Users should be able to sign up and log in to access the feed page.


2. Feed Page
This is a protected route, accessible only to logged-in users.


All users can see posts from all other users.


Posts should be displayed with the most recent at the top.


You may ignore most of the design elements — focus only on the main functionality of the feed.


Required functionalities:
Ability to create posts with text and image.


Show posts with the newest first.


Display like/unlike state correctly.


Implement comments, replies, and their like/unlike system.


Show who has liked a post, comment, or reply.


Support private and public posts:


Private: Visible only to the author


Public: Visible to everyone



Things to Consider
Follow best practices for development, security, and performance.


Use standard database design and modeling practices.


Design the system assuming millions of posts and reads.


Security and User Experience (UX) should be your top priorities.
